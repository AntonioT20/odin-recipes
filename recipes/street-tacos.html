            <li>1/2 tsp ground coriander.</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp chili powder.</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt.</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>24 street taco sized tortillas of choice.</li>
            <li>1/3 cup minced white onion.</li>
            <li>1/3 cup minced cilantro.</li>
            <li>Choice of hot sauce.</li>
            <li>A lime</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="para-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>In a gallon-size resealable bag, place chicken, lime juice, vegetable oil, garlic, cumin, coriander and chili powder. Reseal the bag, and massage bag until chicken is evenly coated. Marinate for 1 to 2 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and place on the hot grill. Discard marinade. Grill over direct heat until juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Chop chicken into small pieces and set aside, keeping it warm.</li>
            <li>Place tortillas on the hot grill, stacked 2 tortillas thick, and heat for about 20 to 30 seconds; flip each stack and heat an additional 20 to 30 seconds. Divide the chicken mixture between the 12 stacks of tortillas. Top with onion and cilantro and drizzle with hot sauce, if desired. Serve with lime wedges.</li>
